// Nathan loves cycling.

// Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

// You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

// For example:

using System;

public class Kata
{
  public static int Litres(double time)
  {
    //The fun begins here.
    return (int) (time/2);
  }
}
